USER: how about without a contract

ASSISTANT: The iPhone 4 launch price in the United States without a contract (no commitment) was $599 for the 16GB model and $699 for the 32GB model. These prices applied to devices locked to AT&T but sold without the requirement of a two-year service agreement. It’s important to note that "no contract" did not mean "unlocked"—the phones were still carrier-locked to AT&T at this price point. Fully unlocked iPhone 4 units (not carrier-locked) were introduced later in the U.S., with prices starting at $649 for the 16GB model and $749 for the 32GB model [Source 1] [Source 4].
